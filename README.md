# NTFSDirectorySystem
Fast NTFS Directory Scan and Search
This is a version of NTFS-Search with all the MFC code removed and made into a single class.
It performs a fast scan of NTFS file system on Windows.  

You can then search for files in the scanned disks.  You get a callback for each file that matches the extension list
